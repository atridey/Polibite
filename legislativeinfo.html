            <p class= "congress-description">Congress, the legislative branch of the United States government, is a bicameral body composed of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each plays a crucial role in the law-making process, but they have different responsibilities and powers.</p>

            <div class="congress-details">
                <div class="congress-card">
                    <h3>The Senate</h3>
                    <p>The Senate is made up of 100 members, two from each state, regardless of population. Senators serve six-year terms, and every two years, approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Role in Lawmaking:</strong> Senators propose and vote on legislation, but bills must pass both the Senate and the House to become law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Powers:</strong> The Senate has the unique power to ratify treaties, approve presidential appointments, and conduct impeachment trials.</li>

                <div class="congress-card">
                    <h3>The House of Representatives</h3>
                    <p>The House of Representatives consists of 435 members, with the number of Representatives from each state determined by its population. Representatives serve two-year terms, and every seat is up for election every two years.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Role in Lawmaking:</strong> All bills for raising revenue (like taxes) must originate in the House, though the Senate can propose amendments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Powers:</strong> The House has the exclusive power to impeach federal officials and to elect the President in the event of an Electoral College tie.</li>

            <h2 class="congress-header">How a Bill Becomes a Law</h2>
            <p class="congress-description">The process of turning a bill into a law involves several key steps, each of which provides opportunities for debate, revision, and amendment. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at each step:</p>
            
            <div class="law-steps">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>1. Introduction of a Bill</h3>
                    <p>A member of Congress introduces a bill. In the House, it‚Äôs placed in the hopper (a box on the Clerk‚Äôs desk), while in the Senate, a Senator may introduce the bill during the ‚Äúmorning hour.‚Äù Once introduced, the bill is assigned a number and referred to a committee.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>2. Committee Action</h3>
                    <p>Committees are the backbone of the legislative process. The bill is referred to the relevant committee, which reviews, holds hearings, and revises it. If a committee decides to advance the bill, it is reported to the floor of the House or Senate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>3. Floor Action</h3>
                    <p>In the House, bills are debated and amendments are made by the full membership. In the Senate, debate is unlimited unless cloture (a procedure to end debate) is invoked. Both chambers must pass identical versions of the bill for it to move forward.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>4. Vote</h3>
                    <p>After debate, the bill is voted on. If it passes in one chamber, it moves to the other (House or Senate). If the second chamber makes changes, the revised bill must go back to the original chamber for approval.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>5. Conference Committee</h3>
                    <p>If both chambers pass different versions of the bill, a conference committee is formed to reconcile the differences. The final bill, called a conference report, must be approved by both the House and Senate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>6. Presidential Action</h3>
                    <p>Once Congress passes the final version of the bill, it goes to the President, who can either sign it into law or veto it. If vetoed, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>7. Bill Becomes Law</h3>
                    <p>If the President signs the bill or if Congress overrides a veto, the bill becomes law. It is then enforced by the appropriate government agencies.</p>
